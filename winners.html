        <h2>NBA Champions 2020-21</h2>
        <p>The 2021 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2020–21 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Eastern Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, 4–2, winning their first NBA championship in 50 years and their second title overall. Holding home-court advantage, the Suns led the series 2–0 before the Bucks came back and won the next four games. With the COVID-19 pandemic altering the NBA's schedule for the second consecutive year, the start date of the series was pushed from its usual time in late May or early June to July 6, the second-latest start in Finals' history.
        </p>
        <p> Milwaukee and Phoenix were two of five teams in the league with an active championship drought of 50 years or more. Prior to 2021, the Bucks won their only title in 1971, while the Suns have yet to win a title since joining the league in 1968. The 2021 Finals was the first since 1971 to not include any players who had previously won an NBA championship. The Suns' Jae Crowder was the only player in the series who previously played in the Finals, making it just the second time since the first Finals that fewer than two players had previously appeared in the championship series; no players had previously played in the Finals in the 1977 series.
