            <h2>MVP - Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2>
            <P>Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994, the son of immigrants from Nigeria. Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, under the care of his grandparents. Adetokunbo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia. Giannis Antetokounmpo was crowned NBA Finals MVP after leading the Milwaukee Bucks to their first championship since 1971 in a six-game series win over the Phoenix Suns. The 26-year-old forward became the youngest player to win Finals MVP since Kawhi Leonard did so at the age of 22 in 2014. In his first Finals appearance, Antetokounmpo dominated by averaging 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds and five assists per game. His remarkable combination of athleticism and skill overwhelmed the Suns, but before the series began, it wasn't even clear that he would be able to play.
            </P>
            <P>Antetokounmpo hyperextended his left knee in the Eastern Conference finals against the Atlanta Hawks and missed the last two games of that series. He was initially listed as doubtful for Game 1 of the Finals, but fought his way back onto the court to play in all six games. He wasn't great in Game 1, scoring only 20 points in a loss, but he erased any doubt about his health with back-to-back 40-point performances in Games 2 and 3. Then, in Games 4 and 5, he gave the Bucks two of the most iconic plays in Finals history.
